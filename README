bfc
===

A tiny brainf*ck to C transpiler. I found it easier to make this than an actual
interpreter.

You can read about it on my blog: http://kaki.envs.net/blog/the-tiny-transpiler

usage
-----
First, clone the repo (or just download bfc.c, it's the only file you really
need.)

	$ git clone https://codeberg.org/Kaamkiya/bfc

Then build it.

	$ cd bfc
	$ make

Basic usage:

	$ bfc [path/to/file.b]

If you don't specify a file to read from, bfc will read from stdin, so you can
also pipe to it:

	$ cat hello_world.b | bfc

It will write the transpiled code to stdout, or you can specify a file using
redirection:

	$ cat hello_world.b | bfc > hello.c

Then you can compile your C file.
